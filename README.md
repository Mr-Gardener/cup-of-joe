## Overview

Cup of Joe is a blog site i saw and decided to test out my little react skills on. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View and toggle between each navigation list

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](#link#)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

Having encountered some difficulties while building this blog site, I will like to improve more on learning how vanilla javascript works, and also hooks on react.

## Acknowledgments
I acknowledge myself for trying to build this up to this level even though I am still lacking in some basic skills in vanilla javascript. I will come back to this project in times to come to add more functionalities to it. Thanks.
